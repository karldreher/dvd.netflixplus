# NetflixPlus
Adds functionality for **DVD**.netflix.com users. 
NetflixPlus is currently at version `1.4.0`.

This addon restores functionality which Netflix removed years ago - the ability to jump to an Instant Watch page from a DVD page if the title is available for instant watch (RATHER THAN simply starting the video).  The advantage to doing so is mainly for Instant Watch Queue (or My List) management; a user could then add it to the list to watch later and remove it from the DVD Queue, for instance.  

As of version `1.3.0`, this extension also includes an omnibox feature!  From the search bar in your browser, type "dvd" and a space, and you can quickly search the DVD.netflix.com site for a movie.

## Chrome Notes: 

As of December 2018, there is no official extension published in the Web Store for NetflixPlus.  The extension was taken down at some time when Netflix changed some elements of their UI which broke this extension.  At some point Google identified that "the extension did not provide any functionality" and issued a takedown notice, but provided the opportunity to appeal based on "manual review (of) policy compliance".  After repeated attempts to engage in this process, there has been no meaningful response from Google other than multiple copies of the same form letter indicating the takedown.  

The source code and Chrome manifest will be maintained in this project for educational purposes.
