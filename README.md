# netflixplus
Adds functionality for **DVD**.netflix.com users. 

This addon restores functionality which Netflix removed years ago - the ability to jump to an Instant Watch page from a DVD page if the title is available for instant watch (RATHER THAN simply starting the video).  The advantage to doing so is mainly for Instant Watch Queue (or My List) management; a user could then add it to the list to watch later and remove it from the DVD Queue, for instance.  


Recently, NetflixPlus achieved release 1.1.1.
