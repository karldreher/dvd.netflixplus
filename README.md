Adds functionality for **DVD**.netflix.com users. 

This is an experimental firefox addon.  This addon restores functionality which Netflix removed years ago - the ability to jump to an Instant Watch page from the DVD queue if the title is available for instant watch (RATHER THAN simply starting the video).  The advantage to doing so is mainly for Instant Watch Queue (or My List) management; a user could then add it to the list to watch later and remove it from the DVD Queue, for instance.  


At this point, it does not work reliably enough to release to the addon marketplace, but the core Javascript has no issue running and demonstrating the intended function of this addon.  Copy the whole contents of the Javascript file into the console when viewing your Netflix **DVD** Queue, this will add red "Instant" links anywhere that you also see the "Play" button.  

Possible resolutions could include changing the behavior from automatic to user-driven (clicking a button to display the links).
